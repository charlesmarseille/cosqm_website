The CoSQM is a sky quality camera comprising 5 colors of filters: clear, R, G, B, Y.
The brightness of the night sky is measured in mag/arcsec^2 (lower means brighter).
Based on a flask/django backbone, an apache2 wsgi server enables a safe serving of data publicly.

Instructions: choose station, date in YYYY-MM-DD format (including tacks) and colors of filters to be graphed. Right-click to save figure. 

All code is open-source.
